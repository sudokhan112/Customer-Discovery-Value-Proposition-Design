# Customer-Discovery-Value-Proposition-Design

This repo contains modues from the course [Intro to Customer Discovery - Fall 2020](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/428857). It was a training offered by NSF to researchers who wants to convert ideas into products.

**What are the course objectives?**
* Develop familiarity with Lean LaunchPad concepts, methods, and tools, such as customer discovery, value proposition design, and business model canvas.
* Increase the commercialization potential of your innovation by applying Lean LaunchPad tools and related techniques, with the intention of understanding how to build a business case for your innovation and how you can tailor your commercialization research to support that business case.
* Ensure you "get out of the building" to understand the real-world problems customers are trying to solve and how your technology might be applied to provide a differentiated advantage from THEIR perspective.
* Build an understanding of â€“ and connections to - the commercial ecosystem for your innovation.
* Use the in-session, hands-on activities, as well as between-session homework and meetings with potential customers and expert resources to develop a compelling commercialization research proposal.

### 0.1 Introduction to I-Corps and Lean LaunchPad
MWIN, our NSF sponsored Midwest Innovation Corps Node, exists to help aspiring innovators and entrepreneurs develop the mindset, toolset, skillset, and network needed to translate your ideas and IP into customer solutions that generate economic value.  NSF I-Corps has endorsed the Lean LaunchPad methodology as the foundational approach taught by all I-Corps Sites around the country.  Also called the Lean Startup approach.

### 1.1 Value Proposition Design

Commercial success begins with testing your assumptions about the value of your technology with the target customers you hope to serve.  Be forewarned:  many of your initial assumptions will be wrong!  Therefore, it's critical that you test your assumptions with customers early and adapt the design of your solution accordingly--before you spend significant time and money developing a solution the customer doesn't want and won't buy.  This is an iterative process of "getting out of the building" early and often to interview and observe customers and ensure you are (1) addressing a problem that matters to them and (2) designing a solution that is better than the current alternatives from THEIR point of view.  The Value Proposition Canvas is a valuable tool to guide your work.
