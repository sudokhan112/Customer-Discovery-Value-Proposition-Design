# Customer-Discovery-Value-Proposition-Design

This repo contains modues from the course [Intro to Customer Discovery - Fall 2020](https://umich.instructure.com/courses/428857). It was a training offered by NSF to researchers who wants to convert ideas into products.

**What are the course objectives?**
* Develop familiarity with Lean LaunchPad concepts, methods, and tools, such as customer discovery, value proposition design, and business model canvas.
* Increase the commercialization potential of your innovation by applying Lean LaunchPad tools and related techniques, with the intention of understanding how to build a business case for your innovation and how you can tailor your commercialization research to support that business case.
* Ensure you "get out of the building" to understand the real-world problems customers are trying to solve and how your technology might be applied to provide a differentiated advantage from THEIR perspective.
* Build an understanding of â€“ and connections to - the commercial ecosystem for your innovation.
* Use the in-session, hands-on activities, as well as between-session homework and meetings with potential customers and expert resources to develop a compelling commercialization research proposal.

### 1.1 Value Proposition Design

Commercial success begins with testing your assumptions about the value of your technology with the target customers you hope to serve.  Be forewarned:  many of your initial assumptions will be wrong!  Therefore, it's critical that you test your assumptions with customers early and adapt the design of your solution accordingly--before you spend significant time and money developing a solution the customer doesn't want and won't buy.  This is an iterative process of "getting out of the building" early and often to interview and observe customers and ensure you are (1) addressing a problem that matters to them and (2) designing a solution that is better than the current alternatives from THEIR point of view.  The Value Proposition Canvas is a valuable tool to guide your work.

### 1.2 Customer Roles

The end-user is the target customer that ultimately will use your product or service.  In addition to this end-user,  typically there are additional stakeholders that influence the purchasing process and decision. Some of these stakeholders or customer roles must endorse or approve the decision to purchase your solution; others don't necessarily say yes, but they can say no or otherwise influence the decision-maker to reject your offering.  Therefore, it is critical to identify each of these key customer roles, understand their unique interests and concerns, and adapt your value proposition to overcome any critical barriers to adoption.

[Lecture Video 2](https://youtu.be/w6NQZVM1sU8)

Identify your customer buying center. Using the [Customer Roles Worksheet](https://github.com/sudokhan112/Customer-Discovery-Value-Proposition-Design/blob/main/Customer%20Roles%20Worksheet.pdf), identify the key customer roles you believe will be influential in the buying decision for your offering.


### 1.3 Define the Problem

Seek first to understand.  Before you can test the potential value of your proposed solution, you must first understand the problem your target customers and key stakeholders care about, how they currently solve the problem, what pains and frustrations they have with their current solution, and what gains or improvements they would like to see in a better solution. Understanding the problem and needs from the customer's point of view BEFORE you spend significant time and money developing a solution based on assumptions about the customer problem is key to success.

[Lecture Slides](https://github.com/sudokhan112/Customer-Discovery-Value-Proposition-Design/blob/main/1-3%20Define%20the%20Problem.pdf)

Use a copy of the **Value Proposition Canvas** to capture your initial responses to describe the target customer segment you are targeting. 

* Name the segment and briefly describe the key characteristics of this segment that distinguish it from other segments.
* Describe the job your customer is trying to accomplish. What outcome does your target customer want to achieve?  How do your customers measure success (i.e., what metrics do they consider most important, and what level of improvement do they seek on these metrics)? 
* What are the critical steps in your target customers' workflow as they complete this job currently?
* Define the problem. What is the fundamental problem you believe your target customers are trying to solve while completing this job? 
* What 2-3 pains and/or desired gains do you believe are most important to your customers?

### 1.4 Identify the Solution

Now that you have documented your assumptions about the problem your target customers are trying to solve, the pains and desired gains that matter most to them, and the key concerns of influential stakeholders, it's time to make some initial assumptions about the differentiated solution you believe customers and stakeholders will find better than competitive offerings, alternatives, and substitutes.

[Lecture video 1](https://youtu.be/d3SuMS-LaSc)

[Lecture video 2](https://youtu.be/fbowkzT4iq0)

Using the same **Value Proposition Canvas**, focus on the lefthand side (solution), and capture your initial responses to the following questions:

**Pain relievers:** 
* How does your solution help your customers overcome important pains? 
* How will your solution help eliminate functional, emotional, or social pains in the current customer experience?

**Gain creators:** 
* What improvements (functional, emotional, or social) can you offer customers to help them achieve articulated or unarticulated benefits that will improve their performance on metrics that matter most to them?

**Products and services:** 
* What new, unique, and differentiated products and/or services can you offer your target customers? 
* How do you know your solution is unique? 
* What IP strategy will help you protect your differentiation?

### 1.5 Plan Customer Interviews

As previously mentioned, customer discovery is THE key to developing a successful value proposition.  In order to complete 20-30 interviews in the next six weeks, you need to start planning and scheduling your interviews with target customers now. 
* First, block time on your calendar for the next six weeks to ensure you have multiple blocks of time each week when you are available to schedule interviews. 
* Then, start making a list of roles and companies that represent your target customer segment and start identifying specific individuals in these roles and companies who are in your network, recommended by people in your network, or identifiable through LinkedIn or other databases.
* Finally, start planning the assumptions or hypotheses you need to test regarding technology-problem for or product-market fit for your technology.

Your first few interviews will likely be a bit challenging, so start by scheduling your first 2-3 "practice" interviews with people in your network who represent or closely approximate your target customers but are not the ideal customers you want to interview--schedule these interviews a bit later when you have more experience.  In our next module, you'll learn more about how to conduct effective problem interviews.  For now, focus on identifying target customers you want to interview, getting the first 2-3 interviews scheduled, and planning the questions you want to ask to test your most important assumptions.

### 2.1 Problem Interviews

fter identifying your target end-user and other key customer roles, it is essential to get out of the building and ensure you understand the problem(s) these key customers are trying to solve from THEIR perspective.  Until you have validated and prioritized your understanding of the problem(s) that matters most to them and how they currently solve this problem, you won't be in a position to assess the "fit" of your proposed solution or its differentiated value from current options.

The 20-30 interviews you complete during this course should be problem interviews.  Solution interviews as discussed in the next section will come later in your discovery process.

### 2.2 Solution Interviews

You now have some preliminary assumptions about the problem your target customer and key stakeholders are trying to solve, how they currently solve the problem, and their priority pains and desired gains. It is critical to test your understanding of the customer problem(s) early and often with real customers to ensure you are addressing an important need that matters from THEIR perspective.  The 20-30 interviews you complete in this course should be primarily problem interviews to validate your understanding of the problem and inform the next steps in your technical feasibility research and/or product/solution design work.  This said, once you have validated your understanding of the customer problem(s), key pains, and desired gains, you also will need to conduct solution interviews to test (1) how well the solution you envision addresses the priority pains and desired gains of your target customers and (2) how you will need to adapt your solution to offer differentiated value and overcome barriers to adoption.

Your current assumptions about an effective solution are just that--assumptions based on what you now know.  Before you invest time and money in developing a solution based on assumptions that are likely to be wrong, it is critical to test and validate your solution design with your target customers through solution interviews.
